# CITS2200_Project
Data Structures and algorithms project

This project is a multi-part project, which means that it comprises several questions. The topic of this project is to analyse parts of the Wikipedia graph. You will need to create a class that can store and analyse various features of a Wikipedia page graph. This class should implement this interface. Wikipedia contains numerous pages on varied topics. These pages may link to other pages inside Wikipedia. If we treat pages as vertices, and links as directed edges, then Wikipedia can be viewed as a graph. For more information about graphs see the Trees and Graphs and Graph Traversals CITS2200 lectures. We will not be dealing with the entire Wikipedia page graph, as it is too large. Instead, your class should be expected to work with arbitrarily selected subsets of pages along with the links between these pages.


A pair of consectutive lines define an edge in this file.
e.g.  
/wiki/Flow_network  
/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem
